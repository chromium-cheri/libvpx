      "message": "Agree that there are cases where you could skip the !sign_bias case, but assuming it\u0027s needed it should be faster to keep the *-1 and clamp here, as you\u0027d only have to do it once instead of every time you switch sign.\n\nIf ref_frame_sign_bias were uint8_t*, then we could test all 4 biases at once and if any of them were set, then do the !sign_bias case. Suggest we do that as a separate commit to keep this one to just what\u0027s necessary to fix the bug.",
