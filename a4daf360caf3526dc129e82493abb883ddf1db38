      "message": "Your changes look fine to me.\n\nHowever, as an additional suggestion, I wonder if it would help to make this test more precise?\n\nFor example, something like:\n if (mi_row \u003d\u003d 0 \u0026\u0026 y \u003d\u003d 0 \u0026\u0026 (x + step \u003e\u003d w) \u0026\u0026 !right_available)\n\nAt the moment I believe we are ignoring the top-right samples in a lot of cases when they actually contain valid data.\n\nThis is only a suggestion, I have not done any experiments to confirm that it works or would actually improve the coding quality, and perhaps the increased complexity of the test means this is not a useful improvement?",
