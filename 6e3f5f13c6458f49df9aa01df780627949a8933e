      "message": "Hi Hiro,\n\nI tested this change on your CL in chromium[1] and it worked.\n\nHowever, to remove the dependencies on the big headers from vp8 and vp9, I need to remove using of FRAME_TYPE. So now it\u0027s just an int.\n\nAnother option is to define an enum inside the rate controller, something like RC_FRAME_TYPE and cast it to FRAME_TYPE when used.\n\nWhen we roll this into chromium, you need to change the type where it\u0027s used in chromium as well.",
