      "message": "No, it\u0027s not allowed in C89. I can\u0027t find a link to a free copy of the C89 spec, but this quote is from the C99 rationale:\n\nThe C89 Committee considered proposals for permitting automatic aggregate initializers to consist of a brace-enclosed series of arbitrary execution-time expressions, instead of just those usable for a translation-time static initializer. Rather than determine a set of rules which would avoid pathological cases and yet not seem too arbitrary, the C89 Committee elected to permit only static initializers. This was reconsidered and execution-time expressions are valid in C99.",
