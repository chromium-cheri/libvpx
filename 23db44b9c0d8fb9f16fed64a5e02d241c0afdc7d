      "message": "When I compared the vp9_args and vp9_arg_ctrl_map arrays carefully, I noticed that the entries in the two arrays do not match exactly.\n\nIn this CL I simply added a comment to describe the mismatch between the two arrays. A \"defensive-programming\" change would be to add dummy entries to vp9_arg_ctrl_map for bitdeptharg and inbitdeptharg so that the vp9_args and vp9_arg_ctrl_map arrays are the same size:\n\n                                         VP9E_SET_ROW_MT,\n+#if CONFIG_VP9_HIGHBITDEPTH\n+                                        0,  // bitdeptharg\n+                                        0,  // inbitdeptharg\n+#endif  // CONFIG_VP9_HIGHBITDEPTH\n                                         0 };\n\nThat would make the ARG_CTRL_CNT_MAX macro slightly larger than necessary.
