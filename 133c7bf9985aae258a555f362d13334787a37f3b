Maybe not used for 16x16 yet, but you could probably formulate this in terms of b_width_log2() to support 16x16 and smaller. Or also assert() to make it obvious that 16X16 is not a valid input.",

I still think PLANES is a weird thing to call this, it doesn\u0027t seem to have anything to do with \"planes\" as in y/u/v like we refer to them elsewhere in the codec. Maybe PARTITION_CONTEXTS, PARTITION_LEVEL_OFFSET?",
