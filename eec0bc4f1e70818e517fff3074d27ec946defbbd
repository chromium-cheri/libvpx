      "message": "This looks wrong. pred_mode_conv converts an MB mode to a B mode, but here we seem to have a B mode already, in bmi-\u003eas_mode.first. Unless someone is doing something evil and using this field to pass around data of a different type. Can you redo the patch to get rid of the pred_mode_conv call and send around for review?",
