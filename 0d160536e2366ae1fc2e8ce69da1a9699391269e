      "message": "The above function uses step size +/-1 to search for the best probability and hence use the newp \u003d\u003d oldp as stop criterion.\n\nIn the new function, a coarse search with step size +/-4 is used. The for-loop then has to use newp \u003e oldp (or newp \u003c oldp) as the stop criterion, depending on the initial relative position.\n\nSeems easier to create a new branch to do so. Perhaps we could factor out common sub-functions laster to reduce the code size.",
