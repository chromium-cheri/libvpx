      "message": "This seems like some assumptions are going wrong in the 4x4 code - e.g. we may be adding a ib\u003d0,1,2,3 even though they should be 0 for all (if BLOCK_SIZE_AB4X4), and xd-\u003eab_index should probably be 0-3 instead, right?\n\nHaving ib and wb/wh be inconsistent means that further down, the code that checks which blocks to apply adst/dct to, will fail to do the intended thing, and instead do something essentially at random, I think.",
