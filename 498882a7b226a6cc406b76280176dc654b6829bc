      "message": "The original order was intentional, I wanted the diagonal of the matrix to be in odd numbered locations in the parameter array so it is easy to subtract  1 from these coefficients in a loop and so it is easier to remember how the parameters in the array are ordered. If you want the order to go from {*, *, 0, 256, 0, 256} to {*, *, 0, 256, 256, 0} there are several other locations that much be changed. If you are seeing the parameters come up as {*, *, 0, 256, 256, 0}, then the bug is probably in RANSAC. I can look into that.",
