It can be be forward declared at the top of the file (which is ugly) or set to call optimized function by using vp8_short_idct4x4llm (which seems like the best option). This will allow RTCD with all simd disabled to still call the C version and have the additional benefit of calling the optimized version if for some reason there exists no optimized call to vp8_dequant_idct_add",
