      "message": "I suggest do not do this. I am talking about Android. If you allocate this chunk of memory at the beginning of the whole video decode, you are more likely to get a continues chunk of memory. But if you do this allocation every time, there are two problems. One is it will lead to a lot of delay due to memory allocation for a lot of blocks. Another is the memory you get may be fragmented which will hurt the cache performance.  I could give you the test code which will show this impact on Android.",
