      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nIn this CL, we have enabled Chessboard pattern for the interpolation filter evaluations when the filter is not switchable. To facilitate this, we have introduced a new level in the existing sf: cb_pred_filter_search, which employs the same logic for the actual filter search at higher speeds.\n\nThe combined impact of this CL and its parent wrt its ref commit is: \n```\n                 Instruction Count        BD-Rate Loss(%)       \ncpu   Resolution   Reduction(%)    avg.psnr   ovr.psnr    ssim  \n 0       LOWRES2      2.315         0.0160     0.0208    0.0337\n 0       MIDRES2      2.588         0.0207     0.0189    0.0847\n 0        HDRES2      2.487         0.0260     0.0308    0.1333\n 0       Average      2.464         0.0209     0.0235    0.0839\n```\n\nThe instruction count reduction specified has been measured using command:\n```\n$ perf stat -e instructions:u ./aomenc â€¦\n```\n\nPlease review the CL.\n\nThanks,\nNeeraj",
