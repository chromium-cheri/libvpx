The issue is that tran_low_t is a different datatype depending on CONFIG_VP9_HIGHBITDEPTH so it is possible for some targets to have optimizations only for one set of these branches.\n\nHaving said that, the current code would indeed work and would be more concise if the common routines were not split out into different sections so feel free to change this if you prefer the more compact style.",
