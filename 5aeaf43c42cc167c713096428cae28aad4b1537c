I tried removing a bunch of it a while back but the testing was tricky: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/webm/libvpx/+/563505\n\nThanks for reminding me. Even without removing the calls themselves we probably could remove the specializations which I\u0027m assuming were put in place to allow further optimization. It\u0027s strange that we call x3/x8 based on ssse3/sse4. We\u0027d need to do some speed tests and decide between the two given on most x86 platforms we\u0027re hitting the x8 path.",
