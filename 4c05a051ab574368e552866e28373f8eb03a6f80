      "message": "Don\u0027t recall for sure whether this was an issue still after I added my own plane_block_idx or this was before when I was trying to make it work with c_idx. You can try removing it, but offhand I think it\u0027s required at the moment. Without this, say you\u0027re doing a 16x16 transform and a 64x64 superblock, plane_idx/c_idx doesn\u0027t do the right thing, it thinks block 16 is part of the y plane.",
