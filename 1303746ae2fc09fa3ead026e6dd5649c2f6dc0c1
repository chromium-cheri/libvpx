      "message": "This function became complicated since I wanted to remove any redundant computations. \nThe interface of the subpel search function has the optional sad costs passed for the 4 neighboring integer pel positions. The integer search must compute it in a manner that is most efficient. If I moved this to sub-pel search, then there will be redundant computations, since these positions would likely already have been covered in the full-pel search.",
