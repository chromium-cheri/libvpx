      "message": "these type names are a bit hard to read.. too many capitals crunched together.   Camel case seems to fall apart for acronyms.   Since the style guide doesn\u0027t provide guidance I suggest we follow advice here: \n\nhttp://www.approxion.com/?p\u003d303\n\nAnd for abbreviations / etc longer than 2 chars use camel case.  So SAD becomes Sad and VP9 becomes Vp9 .. \n\n- SadMxNFunc\n- Vp9SadMxNFunc\n\nrather than having to deal with functions that are multiple acronyms in arow....",

      "message": "I knew this one would be the most difficult. I\u0027d say make this pass then a rework could be in order for this file. If we go your way which in general I only mildly dislike, we\u0027d want to adopt this everywhere so one large rename would be good for the test classes, etc.\nIf the file was split or the names namespaced it would be a non-issue. Alternate names could be used too.",
