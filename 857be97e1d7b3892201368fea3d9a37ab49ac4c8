      "message": "Maybe compiler has already done this:\nnum_values is only used to get the const multiplier, so its values could be 384, 256 and 171 instead of 4, 6, 9.\n\nLooks like there are only 2 cases: top/bottom row, and other rows. So only 2 sets of multipliers need be initialized to a const static table.\nAfter const multipliers8[2][8], multipliers16[2][16] is created, all calculations in this function could be SIMDed.",
