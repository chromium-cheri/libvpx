      "message": "stderr was intentional, since stdout can be used to pipe the encoded data to a different process, we want to avoid mixing them. You should be able to redirect stderr to your log.\n\nIf the concern is that you want to log without the per-frame progress spam, we could introduce a new --quiet option to suppress that (this would be useful anyway). Although --verbose --quiet would be both useful and confusing. Maybe an enum --progress\u003d[none|simple|full]\n\nA related idea I had that may or may not be useful in your context is to have a simpler per-frame progress (say a dot per frame, maybe with a K for keyframes or something) that would be used when the output stream is not a TTY. This would be useful in some of the continuous build/test stuff I\u0027ve been looking at.",
