      "message": "Our options seem to be manually packing with defines, (unpacked) enums, or packed enums.\n\nUsing the wrong type places does seem to have crept in with the defines. \n\nScott did get a real speedup converting these from enums in the first place. (Although this branch does probably have enough of a slow down that it\u0027s less relevant). \n\nPacked enums seems to be a reasonable tradeoff between the two. \n\nWe can put the ifdeffery in one header just like we do for DEPRECATED, UNUSED, and FORCE_INLINE.",
