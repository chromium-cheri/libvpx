      "message": "The average number of bits left per frame in the gf group seems a big number to use here. Also is there any mileage in taking into account the distribution of highq vs low q blocks.\n\nPerhaps we really want to pass a bits per MB target into the requlate_q function as this is what it gets turned into internally. Then we work out a bits per MB target for each block type such that the total for all blocks \u003d target_bits_per_frame.",
