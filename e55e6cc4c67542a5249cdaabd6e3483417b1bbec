      "message": "I see what you mean. However note that sb_index, mb_index, b_index needs to co-exist and things may get tricky to manage.\n\nThe code in this patch is difficult only because I wanted to keep the flexibility of the mode info structure changing in the future. If we freeze the structure, the offsets could be hard-coded.",
