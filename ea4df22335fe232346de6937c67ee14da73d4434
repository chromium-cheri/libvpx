      "message": "I think num_pels_log2_lookup should go away ?   it seems completely unnecessary.  why not just have the lookup return the pixels everywhere/ \n\nDown below we apparently have \npd-\u003edequant[1]\u003e\u003e3  ?   why is that?   If I use it again is it ok for me to sometimes pass in pd-\u003edequant[1] \u003e\u003e 2   why would I want that?   Is this yet another magic number?",
