      "message": "This change is related to https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/webm/libvpx/+/5073697. I was wondering if it was safe to change the decode deadline parameter to be of the unsigned long type, so that we could use the same `vpx_codec_deadline_t` typedef for both the encode and decode deadline parameters.\n\nBut I found that the decode deadline parameter is actually ignored, and all the `vpx_codec_decode()` calls I have seen pass 0 as the deadline. So clients of libvpx don\u0027t need to use the long type when they call `vpx_codec_decode()`. I think we can leave the long type unchanged and just define a typedef for the encode deadline parameter.",

      "message": "The ABI check failed because of the change to the `vpx_codec_decode_fn_t` type above, which results in a change to the `vpx_codec_iface` struct here. This is a false positive because this header (vpx/internal/vpx_codec_internal.h) is a private header and the type definitions in this header are not visible to the clients of the libvpx public API.\n\nIn the public header vpx/vpx_codec.h, the type `struct vpx_codec_iface` is used, but it is an incomplete type, which means the struct definition is not available.",
