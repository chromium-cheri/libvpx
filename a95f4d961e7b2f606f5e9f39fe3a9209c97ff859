In libvpx we recommend setting up a remote named for-master with the following settings:\n\n    url \u003d https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/webm/webm-tools\n    push \u003d HEAD:refs/for/master\n\nWhich we then use this way:\n    $ git push for-master\n\n\nSo we don\u0027t have to:\n    $ git push https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/webm/webm-tools HEAD:refs/for/master\n\n\nThis is just another way of doing the same thing, correct?\n\nAlso, the webm/libvpx part of the repo URL, is it inferred based on project name?",
