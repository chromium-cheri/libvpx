      "message": "I thought the encoder was fine with odd width/height? Doesn\u0027t it just extend?\n\nThe validity of odd YV12/I420 isn\u0027t really the point, and yes it\u0027s a good practice to show people that this is a bad thing. If you want to keep the odd check (assuming I\u0027m correct and the encoder is OK with it) I think you need an explanation about why it\u0027s rejected given that this is example code.",
