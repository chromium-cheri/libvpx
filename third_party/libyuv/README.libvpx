Description:
libyuv is an open source project that includes YUV conversion and scaling
functionality.

The optimized scaler in libyuv is used in multiple resolution encoder example,
which down-samples the original input video (f.g. 1280x720) a number of times
in order to encode multiple resolution bit streams.

Local Modifications:
<<<<<<< HEAD   (efd115 Merge commit '9e7b09bc' into highbitdepth)
Modified the original scaler code from C++ to C to fit in our current build
system. This is a temporal solution, and will be improved later.
=======
Modified the original scaler code minimally with include file changes to fit
in our current build system.
>>>>>>> BRANCH (debd04 Merge "Further first pass allocation changes.")
