      "message": "if you\u0027re not going to make this go down to 4x4, we should rename it MB_SIZE_TYPE or something like that, and its members MB_SIZE_32X16 etc. MB vs SB is pretty meaningless, I don\u0027t think it needs to be included. There will be other block sizes smaller than 16x16, it\u0027d be unfortunate and potentially confusing to claim the whole BLOCK_SIZE_ namespace for this use case.",
