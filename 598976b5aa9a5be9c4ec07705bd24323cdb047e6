      "message": "There are 2n+1 pixel values: n on the left, n on the top and 1 for the topleft corner. All of these pixels are filtered including the corner one. x[n] (y[n]) is the unfiltered (filtered) version of the topleft. After filtering and creating the y[n], I put the pixels back in the right places. Note the above[-1] \u003d y[n] line - which restores the topleft.",
