      "message": "The fix looks good. I think I made a mistake when I merged into the tip, the codebase I was working on did not have svc_force_zero_mode. thanks.\nBTW, one thing I found confusing is whether one could always assume that  LAST_FRAME is always a reference frame when an inter frame is coded. It could be that GOLDEN_FRAME is the only reference frame, no?\nFor now though it looks good since all base layer reference frames are of type GOLDEN_FRAME.",
