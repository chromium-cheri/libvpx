      "message": "if you\u0027re not going to make this go down to 4x4, we should rename it MB_SIZE_TYPE or something like that, and its members MB_SIZE_32X16 etc. MB vs SB is pretty meaningless, I don\u0027t think it needs to be included. There will be other block sizes smaller than 16x16, it\u0027d be unfortunate and potentially confusing to claim the whole BLOCK_SIZE_ namespace for this use case.",

      "message": "No it\u0027s a good point - the original plan (I\u0027m hoping that will still work) was to eventually go down to 8x8 and perhaps lower sizes here, that\u0027s just not finished yet. I\u0027m hoping to get to that soon. I\u0027ll remove the sb/mb prefix at that point also (I agree with the point you\u0027re making).",
