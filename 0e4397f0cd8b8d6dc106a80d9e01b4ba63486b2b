Paul, is there some check in the IDCT to skip reconstruction if skip_block is set? Christian tested and the output doesn\u0027t change if we put random data in qcoeff_ptr/dqcoeff_ptr, but I don\u0027t see any condition around the call to idct() in encodeframe.c like if (!b-\u003eskip_block), so I\u0027m not sure why that works...",
