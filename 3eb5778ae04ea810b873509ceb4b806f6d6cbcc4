      "message": "The change looks correct to us. \n\nAlternatively, the condition for reallocation can be modified as below to avoid reallocations when the frame size is smaller than dest_size:\n```\n      cpi-\u003evp9_bitstream_worker_data[1].dest_size \u003c\n          encode_tiles_buffer_alloc_size(cpi)\n```\nThough above condition avoids the reallocations at run-time when resolution is reduced, we feel that the approach in the current CL tries to keep average run-time memory consumption low.",
