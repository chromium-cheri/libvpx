      "message": "We usually (at least in the decoder\u0027s code) use short bw or bh names for block width/height in pixels (and bwl/bhl for log). \n\nI also think it\u0027s good not to use ab/sb block prefixes anymore because they are confusing. We can refer to the different block sizes as b4, b8, etc.",

Do not worry about saving horizontal space as it is far more important to make your code immediately understandable by a new reader. Do not use abbreviations that are ambiguous or unfamiliar to readers outside your project, and do not abbreviate by deleting letters within a word.\"\n\nbh and bw were inconsistently and incorrectly used throughout the code - there are multiple instances of this.   \n\nThe names are poor - is bw bandwidth, superblock width,  4x4 blocks wide or something else....",
