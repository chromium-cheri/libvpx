Do this:\n\n    git describe --match\u003dv[0-9]* 2\u003e/dev/null\n\nWhy: the WebM project does not build or ship VPX.framework: Users build it with the config(s) needed. \n\nThe framework should be tagged with what\u0027s in the repo from which it was built, not a dotted version number that has no basis in reality (git describe will return simply a version number if actually on a tag). Tagging a VPX.framework built from HEAD w/v1.5.0 is not correct.",
