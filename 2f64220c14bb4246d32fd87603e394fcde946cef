      "message": "future suggestion: use movd, not pextrd(0).\n\nAlternatively, you could unroll this loop somewhat to handle 2 or 4 lines at a time, so that the packs_epi32() and the packus_epi16() handle a full register worth of data. Then again, you might have to specialcase the last line since you have 11 lines to handle here, and you don\u0027t want to handle a 12th dummy line, so overall I\u0027m not sure it\u0027s worth it. Use your best judgement. :-).",
