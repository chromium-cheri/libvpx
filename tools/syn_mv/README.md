git clone https://github.com/glfw/glfw.git
```
*Install CMake:
```
sudo apt-get install cmake
```
*Install Doxygen:
```
sudo apt-get install doxygen
```
*Go to GLFW directory:
```
cd <glfw directory>
```
*Use cmake to generate make file
```
cmake .
```
*Install
```
make
make install
```
Now, glfw should be installed in /usr/local/include/

#GLM
GLM is a math library for OpenGL which has the same data type as GLSL.

*Download GLM from the official website: https://github.com/g-truc/glm/releases/tag/0.9.9.5
*Unzip downloaded file
```
unzip glm-0.9.9.5.zip
```
*Go to glm directory
```
cd glm
```
*Use CMake to generate makefile
```
cmake .
```
*Install
```
make
make install
```

#Link OpenGl, GLFW and GLEW by Using CMake

In your CMakeLists.txt,

*Add OpenGL and GLFW packages
```
find_package(glfw3  REQUIRED)
find_package(OpenGL REQUIRED)
```
*Add Executable
```
add_executable(<-executable name-> <-executable source name->)
```
*Link libraries:
```
target_link_libraries(<-executable name-> glfw OpenGL GLEW ← other lib names -->)
```
