      "message": "Thanks for pointing out that rate_y is set to a meaningless number when disable_skip is 1. returnrate_nocoef is the rate for indicating coding parameters. I feel that it should not be set as 0 in any case. If disable_skip \u003d 1, returnrate_nocoef \u003d rate2 - vp10_cost_bit(vp10_get_skip_prob(cm, xd), 1). I can update the patch, since I also realize that something might be wrong when obmc is also on.",
