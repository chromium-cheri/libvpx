      "message": "To me this is an example of a low value - unit test that I hope we don\u0027t get in practice of writing.   \n\nI say this, because I think this is just testing that the parameters passed through the function actually get to the codec.   \n\nIts not testing that they are used to make the codec run a whole lot faster for all but the difficult clips or produce better quality on the right parts of the video frame etc.   \n\nI think a more valuable test would test this kind of thing.   \n\nI think this code serves the purpose I asked for ( a learning experience) and should ask as a good discussion point for the kind of unit tests we choose to write or not write.",

      "message": "Agreed, though it does actually explicitly trap some things we had missed before....like the fact that some settings are incompatible (e.g.using roi maps and cyclic refresh at the same time). Also if this example was anything to go by there may be other cases where we do not properly check that passed in parameters are valid / correctly passed through.",
