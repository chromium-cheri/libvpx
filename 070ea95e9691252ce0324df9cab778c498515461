      "message": "Here, if pred_error is too large, then don\u0027t use this mode, and continue to check next mode.\nStatic threshold skipping focuses on small pred_error cases. If pred_error is small enough, we pick this mode and don\u0027t check any other modes. Also, don\u0027t transmit any residual data.\nSo, these two are different. Right?",
