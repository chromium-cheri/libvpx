      "message": "have you given any thought to whether the number of tiles must be a power of 2? It seems like if this were a little more flexible, you could more closely align the tile width to a SB boundary, and that would help quality. For example, 1920 could be packed into 3 or 5 tiles, but if you pack it into 4, then you lose the 64x64 mode on 1/8 sbs. This will come up with other resolutions too with spatial scalability, 3/2 and 5/4 are useful scaling factors.",
