      "message": "This CL disables the AVX intrinsic of `vp9_diamond_search_sad()` function, as it has been found to provide poor scaling w.r.t C implementation. We have confirmed this behaviour by performing a timer based profiling.\n\nThe average instruction count reduction for Good encoding mode.\n```\n      Instruction Count\ncpu   Reduction(%)\n0         -0.107\n1          0.111\n2          0.177\n3          0.315\n4          0.229\n5          0.214\n```\nFurthermore, we measured the instruction count values for the RT case and observed an insignificant change in the instruction count.\n\nThis is a bit-exact change.\n\nThe instruction count reduction specified has been measured using command:\n\n`$ perf stat -e instructions:u ./vpxenc â€¦`",
