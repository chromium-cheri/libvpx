Description:
libyuv is an open source project that includes YUV conversion and scaling
functionality.

The optimized scaler in libyuv is used in the multiple resolution encoder
example which down-samples the original input video (f.g. 1280x720) a number of
times in order to encode multiple resolution bit streams.
