      "message": "Hi guys,\nI\u0027d like some input on the use of the constants. Right now I\u0027ve copied the file just in case I had to change it for Arm. However, I didn\u0027t have to, it\u0027s exactly the same as the SSE4.1. I don\u0027t know what the policy about such cases is. Should I just include the x86 header from the arm implementations? Should I keep the copy? Should I suggest moving the constants to common and modify both x86 and arm headers to include that?",
