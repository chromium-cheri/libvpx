// This structure holds bit masks for all 8x8 blocks in a 64x64 region.
// Each 1 bit represents a position in which we want to apply the loop filter.
// Left_ entries refer to whether we apply a filter on the border to the
// left of the block.   Above_ entries refer to whether or not to apply a
// filter on the above border.   Int_ entries refer to whether or not to
// apply borders on the 4x4 edges within the 8x8 block that each bit
// represents.
// Since each transform is accompanied by a potentially different type of
// loop filter there is a different entry in the array for each transform size.
