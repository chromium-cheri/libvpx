      "message": "Previously col[128] was defined as __m128i, which told the compiler that this took an array of xmm registers. But the only use of it is to intermediately buffer the first 1-D inverse transform results. There is no need to let compiler make arrangement to swap the data between xmm and regular stack when accessing this intermediate buffer(?)",
