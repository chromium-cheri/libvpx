      "message": "Hi Jerome, this patch doesn\u0027t work and I cannot debug it by myself; in L3T1 encoding, the produced bitrate in L1 and L2 overshoot very much. I didn\u0027t run L3T3 but I expect the same problem will happen.\nIt seems like some side-effects in ComputQP() and PostEncode() causes some bugs in calling them like ComputeQP() to L1, L2, L3 and thereafter PostEncodeEncode() to L1, L2, L3.\nCould you debug it?",
