I was looking at the \"Extreme Values\"  test before.\n\nRunning \"OperationCheck\" instead seems to hit the pathological case for AVX (It runs twice if it hits overflow) and takes ~60% longer to run than SSE2. I modified it to work with lowbd as well and got similar results.\n\nGiven the variability of AVX and lacking information about how likely it is to hit the pathological case, I still vote for removal.",
