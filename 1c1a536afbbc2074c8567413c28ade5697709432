      "message": "Yeah, this was a strange issue. With -Werror, I was getting an ignored return error on the first call to (void)fread(...), but no warning without it. Could be a compiler bug, I just hit it with this sledge hammer given all the problems we\u0027ve been having killing this warning.\n\n6/half-dozen as to killing the other voids, I figured it was more cosmetic and could be done separately. I\u0027ll do it in this patch if you prefer.",
