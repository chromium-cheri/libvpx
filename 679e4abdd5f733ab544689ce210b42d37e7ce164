      "message": "yeah, I think this is all I\u0027m going to get supported in time for launch. I set things up so that we could have for example a 1/4 size depth channel, but there are a few things that we\u0027d have to do differently like rounding MVs that we don\u0027t have to do otherwise, and it\u0027s of somewhat unknown utility. Unless you think otherwise, I think this is a good place to draw the line for this version.",

      "message": "I went with this approach since the necessary symbols are available not under the flag, and it doesn\u0027t impact the output of the code without the flag. I could put it all under a flag just to remove it next week, but it didn\u0027t seem all that useful. If you prefer it be done that way, let me know and I\u0027ll change it.\n\nThese could become [MAX_MB_PLANE] after the experiment is merged, but I don\u0027t like having these mapping arrays at all, and my plan is to move these into YV12_BUFFER_CONFIG or replace that structure entirely, but don\u0027t have time to do it before the freeze. It\u0027s a little messy to have to load alpha_buffer etc into these temp arrays if only 3 planes are in use. All these for loops up to MAX_MB_PLANE will become loops up to the number of planes in use before the experiment can be merged.",
