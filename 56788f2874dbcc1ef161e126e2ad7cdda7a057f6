      "message": "So is the intent here to force use to always use square only for hbd, assuming of course the use_square_partition_only flag is set?  If so why is this done for HBD? Will this not create a difference between 8 bit encodes when HBD is set and 8 bit encodes when HBD is not set where these surely should be the same?",
