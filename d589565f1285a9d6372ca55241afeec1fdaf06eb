      "message": "My main reason for pointing out kMaxDimension here is that we already have a constant defined in this file to use in place of a known value we\u0027re reusing throughout.\n\nAnd, technically you could use it, but it\u0027s probably not worth the effort required (this function would need to move below the ConvolveTest definition, and kMaxDimension would need to be public)... I think. :)\n\nAnyway, with my point being that the magic number should be a constant: \u0027const int kMaxDimension \u003d 64;\u0027 should probably be up near the top of the anon namespace, and then it should be used for assignment to the value within ConvolveTest. (and reused here and elsewhere)",
