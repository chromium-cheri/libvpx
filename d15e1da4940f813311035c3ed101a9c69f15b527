      "message": "these \u0027-\u0027 could be integrated higher.\n\nFor instance, instead of using -x2 here, you could have\nline 755 replaced by:\n\ns2 \u003d (-cospi_16_64) * (x2 + x3);\n\nthe main difference would be at line 760, because\n-round(x) is not equal to round(-x).\n\nBut i\u0027d say that in this case, round(-x) might be more precise than -round(x).\n\nAnd same for x4/x7/x1 etc...\nSomething to keep an eye on, since this code will be the spec.",
