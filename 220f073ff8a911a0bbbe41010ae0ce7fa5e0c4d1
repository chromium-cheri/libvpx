      "message": "1. I made a horrible type in original subset, there must be \"!\u003d 16\" instead of \"\u003d\u003d 16\". \n2. (1 \u003c\u003c (SUBPEL_BITS - 1)): looks like this expression is equal to 8, not 16. There is define for this value (SUBPEL_SHIFTS).\n3. Plain value (16) was more clear than expression for me, may be because asserts like \"assert(y_step_q4 \u003c\u003d 32)\" use plain values. As a possible alternative a can propose a name like \"SUBPEL_NO_CONVOLVE\" or something like this.",
