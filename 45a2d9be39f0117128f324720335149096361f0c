      "message": "it\u0027d be cleaner to make a separate type describing one dimension, and then track the w/h separately:\n\n  enum {\n    BLOCK_4, BLOCK_8, BLOCK_16, BLOCK_32, BLOCK_64\n  }\n\nIf you need a type that has them both, you could combine them in such a way that it\u0027s still easy to pull the w/h out separately:\n\n  enum {\n    BLOCK_16X16 \u003d (BLOCK_16 \u003c\u003c 8) | BLOCK_16,\n    BLOCK_32X16 \u003d (BLOCK_32 \u003c\u003c 8) | BLOCK_16,\n    ...\n  }\n\nStarting the enum at 4 is useful as proved elsewhere, we need to be able to talk about blocks smaller than 16x16, and it\u0027d be nice to be able to use the same type.",

      "message": "I think it\u0027s not hard to generalize this by transform size as well. I\u0027ve got a patch that\u0027s almost ready to go that add a generalized walker so that you can do X for each transformed block in the SB, that we could probably use here and elsewhere it we extend it as necessary to support rectangular blocks.\n\nIf it too much trouble to add, let\u0027s at least use the subsampling_x,y fields rather than hardcoding \u003e\u003e1, -1, etc, that\u0027s trivial to do at this point.",
