The use of --output\u003dpath/to/output instead of \"-o ...\" is because msys is getting confused by these two args in succession (I think):\n\n    -o /tmp/vpx_test_1451/vp8.ivf -\n\nUsing that results in vpxenc.exe saying this:\n\n    Error: Unrecognized option -D:/src/_tools/apps/Git/vp8.iâ˜»\n\n(That\u0027s direct c/p, including the fun magic char at the end)",
