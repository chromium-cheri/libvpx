      "message": "Quoting https://github.com/edelsohn\n\u003eThe focus is systems that assume a minimum ISA with VSX. I don\u0027t expect the code to dynamically test for the feature at runtime. I expected that the library would detect or be configured for VSX when it is built. I sort of assumed that it would fall back to the current, simple C code if not configured for VSX, as opposed to completely failing to build. But a library built with the assumption of VSX is not expected to run on a hardware at an earlier ISA level.\n\nI thins we can remove RTCD for now",
