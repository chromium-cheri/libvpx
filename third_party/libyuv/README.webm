Description:
The optimized scaler in libyuv is used in multiple resolution encoder example,
which down-sampled the original input video (f.g. 1280x720) a number of times
in order to encode multiple resolution bit streams.

Local Modifications:
Modified the original scaler code from C++ to C to fit in our current build
system. This is a temporal solution, and will be improved later.
