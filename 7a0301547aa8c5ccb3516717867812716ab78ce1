      "message": "same fixme here; ideally, we\u0027d keep track of two things: A) the RD of each filter alone (non-switchable), and B) the best filter along with the overhead of signaling it. Then here, given 3 filters and the selectable-between-these-three, we can (based on the RD sums for the whole frame) select which one to use, rather than do it based on counts alone.\n\nFor now, a FIXME is fine, but this should be marked clearly so we can fix it later on.",
