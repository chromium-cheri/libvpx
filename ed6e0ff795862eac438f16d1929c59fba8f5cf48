      "message": "Good catch. We actually don\u0027t operate on a copy of mbmi in the denoiser, I missed that. I think we might want to make a copy of mbmi inside the denoiser rather than resetting things after denoising. It feels safer to be able to assume that the denoiser doesn\u0027t affect things that the encoder relies on.\n\nWhat do you think?",
