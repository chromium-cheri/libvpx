      "message": "I can\u0027t recall the exact reason for having both of these in vp8, but I expect that I\u0027ll be removing both of them in favor of an explicit display width/height, and sort out whether there are really two copies required then. This was just the minimum I needed to do to get the old scaling to trigger. The decoder actually ignores these completely right now (other than parsing them from the bitstream)",
