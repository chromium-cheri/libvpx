      "message": "Hi guys, apologies for the large patchset, however I couldn\u0027t make it smaller as the changes affected quite a few files. Getting the butterfly functions named in a uniform way made it significantly easier to port the 32x32 DCT to highbd (followed in a next patchset) and also much easier to read and debug the code. I tried getting some fast variants of the two coeff butterfly function to use a pair of vqrdmulh_s16, vqrdmlah_s16/vqrdmlsh_s16 (and their 32-bit variants), it worked but unfortunately I couldn\u0027t get the needed accuracy. I\u0027ll keep investigating this though to see if I could use them in some particular usecases.",
