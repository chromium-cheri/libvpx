      "message": "That is a far more complex question than you might think.  \n\nBy and large vp8 doesn\u0027t return an error on a frame it detects as corrupt.  It just marks it as corrupt and returns.  That said there\u0027s a couple of instances when I think this is an issue.  eg when a keyframe is corrupt.  \n\nAs such I\u0027ll fix in a follow on. \n\nNote : VPXDECs count of corrupted frames is at best iffy.   There are lots of cases when no frame was decoded and yet all the buffers are still marked non corrupt etc.",
