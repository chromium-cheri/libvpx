I use the one-line log when preparing the CHANGELOG, and would prefer not to have to cross reference against the issue tracker. Good idea to mention the bug number in the body of the commit message though.",

The user has no way to tell the codec to use this setting, so I think this function should *set* that setting, rather than checking that it is set. The user wants to use this ROI map, if that means that the segment data needs to be transmitted as deltas, then make it so.",
