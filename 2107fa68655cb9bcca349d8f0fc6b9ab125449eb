      "message": "The windows is a good question.  I haven\u0027t investigated that yet.\n\nIt\u0027s as fragile as the iOS SDK.  Meaning that when a new one comes out, we need to update it.  The difference with the two is that iOS puts the sdk in one place.  The NDK doesn\u0027t have a default directory.\n\nI haven\u0027t found a way of deriving the longer paths.\n\nThis will have to be revisited later when we support a x86 android build.  I don\u0027t believe the NDK has yasm, so that\u0027s a little ways off as of yet.",
