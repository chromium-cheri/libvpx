      "message": "Including loopfilter data into this struct is because loopfilter reuses tile threads which set TileWorkerData as hook argument. This is a workaround to avoid to reset data1 all the time. But, moving loopfilter-specific elements here seems a little overdone.",

The bad thing is that right now TileWorkerData for some reason uses LFWorkerData which is designed to be used only by lf_worker. Two different worker data structs are mixed together and it is very confusing.",
