      "message": "Adaptation of bpm_factor is not considering data of last but one gf interval in the GOP, hence calculation of bpm_factor is inconsistent. In addition, the update is done with one frame data in case of last gf interval in the GOP (this frame typically consumes few bits as it can be predicted well from ARF frame), hence bpm_factor is found to be unstable. We tried considering the data of last but one gf interval and last gf interval together for updating bpm_factor, by coupling the consumption and reset of relevant data to avoid above.",
