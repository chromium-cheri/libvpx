      "message": "this seems a little redundant, i.e. if comp_pred_mode \u003d\u003d TRUE (that is, we\u0027re already using a second inter reference frame), then this can\u0027t ever be true, thus you don\u0027t need to code the symbol.\n\nAlternatively, we might want to reconsider how we\u0027re coding the comp_pred_mode flag itself (it\u0027s kind of hacky and prevents us from having \u003e3 ref frames in its current form), i.e. maybe we actually want to write a full second reference (without allowing it to be the same as the first reference, and preventing the redundant combinations A+B vs. B+A).",
