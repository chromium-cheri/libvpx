      "message": "so, this may not be the right place to bring it up (so feel free to ignore for submitting this one - more a general comment), but for the other transforms, we have a wrapper (e.g. vp9_dequant_idct_add_8x8_c) which chooses between the different (e.g. _1, _10 or full) variants depending on how many coefficients were coded. The only one that does not have such a variant (and thus duplicates this logic in each caller) is 4x4. Can we fix that?",
