Later, when we tested the new function, we found it when the project was compiled.\n\nGot it, thanks for confirming that the tests caught it. We can try to add build coverage here if you have a toolchain and a qemu solution that works, otherwise it will be up to your local testing to discover issues.",

LoongArch is a new architecture, some core projects already support it, like GCCï¼Œclang and kernel etc. Once qemu is ready too, we will contact you again and offer the toolchain and qemu together, is that ok.\npresently, we will strengthen local testing to avoid the same problem from happening again.",
