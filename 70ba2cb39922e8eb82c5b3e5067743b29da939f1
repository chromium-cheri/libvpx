IMO, it\u0027s more useful to have the disambiguation, so provided that the rest of the name is sufficiently complex and unlikely to collide, I ignore POSIX on this issue, and elect to fix the collision should it ever happen in the future.\n\nvp9_prob should be changed too, among a bunch of other useless vp9 prefixes.\n\nDo whatever you want.
