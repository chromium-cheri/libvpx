      "message": "A palette consists of two sets of colors: indexed colors and literal colors. For each indexed color, we transmit an index referring to a frame level buffer. For each literal color, we transmit its value with 8 bits. We need to transmit the number of indexed colors and literal colors, and they are both possible to be 0.",

      "message": "I would suggest adding a flag at the frame level to indicate if palette coding is to be used at all. That way you will save bits here for every block if palette coding is not used at all.\nMy guess is that the slight drop for non-screen content videos will disappear if you add that. There are many other instances in the bit-stream where frame level flags are used to enable/disable features completely.",

To take care of the drop on natural videos, we may add a flag to the interface to enable/disable all the features (tx_skip, palette, etc) for screen content videos, like --screen_content\u003d0/1.",
