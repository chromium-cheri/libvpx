I realize this isn\u0027t a lot of cycles altogether, but still, since this is only the \"fast\" rd-pass of the transform, maybe we want to simplify this? E.g. you could remove the +\u003d output[j] \u003e 0 step, which would save 2x8x4 instructions. (This would need some quality assessment, so can be marked as a TODO - possibly in the C code - for later analysis.)",
