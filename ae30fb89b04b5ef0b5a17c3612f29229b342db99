      "message": "As sub-pel MV limits (in case of temporal filtering) are made to match with that sub-pel ME during encoding stage, above checks are removed.  Instead of above, vp9_set_subpel_mv_search_range() call is added to ensure that limits in case of full-pel ME match with that of sub-pel ME. As similar code changes are made in other places, we feel that it is logical to have all these changes together.\n\nPlease let us know your thoughts.",

      "message": "Here, best_ref_mv1 is always 0. In original sub-pixel search, resulted mv is limited by MAX_FULL_PEL_VAL\u003c\u003c3, which is tighter than MV_LOW \u0026 MV_UPP. So, I think it is ok to use vp9_set_subpel_mv_search_range() here. In that way, we can call vp9_set_subpel_mv_search_range() in sub-pixel search function. One disadvantage of leaving this outside of sub-pixel search function is that people would forget to include this call when they write new code to call sub-pixel search function. It happens.",
