      "message": "Our options seem to be manually packing with defines, (unpacked) enums, or packed enums.\n\nUsing the wrong type places does seem to have crept in with the defines. \n\nScott did get a real speedup converting these from enums in the first place. (Although this branch does probably have enough of a slow down that it\u0027s less relevant). \n\nPacked enums seems to be a reasonable tradeoff between the two. \n\nWe can put the ifdeffery in one header just like we do for DEPRECATED, UNUSED, and FORCE_INLINE.",

      "message": "Added the #ifdefs. Can you check if it\u0027s correct?\n\nI think it is worth it, because we get the best of both worlds:\n- Smaller memory use when used in structs etc (which seems to be desirable as seen in the earlier patch I mentioned in commit msg).\n- At the same time, have enums collecting related #defines, and avoid some possible bugs through the use of common \u0027uint8_t\u0027 type (see the s/PARTITION_INVALID/BLOCK_INVALID/ fix in blockd.h)",
