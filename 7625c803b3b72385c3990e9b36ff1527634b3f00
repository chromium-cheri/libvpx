      "message": "i\u0027m actually a little mixed on this. it\u0027s a new code block so you could have\nuint8_t a \u003d a1 \u003c 0 ? 0 : .... etc\n\nbut also checking for \u003c 0 doesn\u0027t make sense - the code is seperate for that case. It could just be\nuint8_t a \u003d a1 \u003e 255 ? 255 : a1\n\nbut maybe it would just move the location of the cast, in which case it\u0027s not really that important.",
