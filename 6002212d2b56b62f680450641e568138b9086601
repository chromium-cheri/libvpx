      "message": "Partly: the original iOS 9 fix was to omit the \"soft_enable media\" line when doing an an arm*darwin* build, but that\u0027s not enough because the RTCD generation code is going to do it\u0027s thing unless explicitly told otherwise, resulting in undef symbol errors for _armv6 and _media functions.\n\nThis comment attempts to head that situation off in the hope that anyone calling these functions will at least read their function comments (ha).\n\nTaking a stab at it. Having this RTCD_OPTIONS\u003d\"${RTCD_OPTIONS} --disable-media \" hanging out in a random place in configure.sh sucks, but so do a lot of things about configure.sh.",
