      "message": "Alex this is another area that\u0027s worth exploring. In assembly code we might have a cascade of loops that do 64, 32, 16, 8, 4. Swapping the order of checks here with for loops might help. At least that would cover cases where intermediate_height is not divisible by 8.\n\nhttps://chromium.googlesource.com/webm/libvpx/+/refs/tags/v1.10.0/vpx_dsp/arm/vpx_convolve_neon.c#26",
