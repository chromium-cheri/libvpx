      "message": "I thought about that. The goal here is to reduce code duplication. A macro works well for that. And also, it is not guaranteed that the compiler will always inline a static function, that may bring overhead.",

If multi-threading is disabled, these multi-thread functions won\u0027t be called at all. Then, we could remove all #if CONFIG_MULTITHREAD in this file. This can be done later in another patch.",
