I\u0027m guessing that l, and a are left and above.  personally there are precisely 2 calls that use the vars... the save and the restore.  calling them entropy_left, entropy_above, partition_left, partition_above won\u0027t cost that much more in terms of code size and are a lot clearer than l,a, sl, sa...     \n\nYou could of course save the extra characters by just putting all of these contexts in one structure so that save_contexts and restore contexts becomes one memcopy...\n\nbsl could either have a better name or could be removed altogether as its used only once ...",
