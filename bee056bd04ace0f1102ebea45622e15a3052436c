      "message": "I printed out the motion vectors here and found some were out of the range (x-\u003emv_col_min/max and x-\u003emv_row_min/max). In some extreme cases, it caused OOB in the bug.\n\nActually I also found that the first clamping was enough to fix the bug... and I agree the clamping may be needed in all positions for safety.\n\nAny thoughts on why motion vectors would be out of that range?",
