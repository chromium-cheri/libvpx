/*!\brief get frame buffer callback prototype
 *
 * This callback is invoked by the decoder to allocate storage for the frame
 * buffer in order for the decode call to complete.
 * The callback can allocate one buffer for all the frame buffers, or one buffer
 * per plane with the number and size of planes determined by fb->fmt.
 * If the application decides to allocate only one buffer, fb->type must be set
 * to #VPX_CODEC_FRAME_BUFFER_SIZE, the buffer size must be at least |min_size|
 * in bytes and the pointer to the buffer must be assigned to fb->data.
 * Then the callback must set fb->size to the allocated size.
 * The application does not need to align the allocated data.
 * If the application decides to allocate one buffer per plane, fb->type must be
 * set to #VPX_CODEC_FRAME_BUFFER_PLANES, the buffer pointers must be assigned
 * to fb->plane, and their strides to fb->stride.
 * The application provided buffers and strides must be aligned to 32 bytes.
 * The callback must zero out all the buffers allocated.
 *
 * The callback is triggered when the decoder needs a frame buffer to
 * decode a compressed image into. This function may be called more than once
 * for every call to vpx_codec_decode. The application may set fb->priv to
 * some data which will be passed back in the ximage and the release function
 * call. |fb| is guaranteed to not be NULL. On success the callback must
 * return 0. Any failure the callback must return a value less than 0.
 *
 * \param[in] priv         Callback's private data
 * \param[in] new_size     Size in bytes needed by the buffer
 * \param[in,out] fb       Pointer to vpx_codec_frame_buffer_t
