The builders have 8.3.0 so to add coverage for this configuration we\u0027d need an adapter or to do the 3 loads. In practice in other projects the compiler was doing the right thing with 3, but for convenience the adapter would be better. Can you add something to vpx_dsp/arm/mem_neon.h or for this?",
