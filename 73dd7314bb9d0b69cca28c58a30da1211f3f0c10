      "message": "Since we die_codec() here it seems fine for this to be void, but this is largely copy/pasted from simple_encoder.c (a bunch of our remaining noise is related to duplicated encoder boiler plate in the examples, and I think encode_frame() is one of the final missing pieces of tools code that will help clean up things on the examples side).\n\nAnyway, not especially fond of this/and could probably use more thought. Likely good enough for the examples, though.",
