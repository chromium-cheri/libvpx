      "message": "this will break the abi, minimally the version at line 86 needs to be bumped. this is still a bit unfortunate since the requests for capabilities isn\u0027t protected by a check, just the instantiation.\nthe check normally goes like:\n#ifdef VPX_CODEC_CAP_HIGHBITDEPTH\n        vpx_codec_caps_t codec_caps \u003d vpx_codec_get_caps(vpx_codec_vp9_cx());\n        if (codec_caps \u0026 VPX_CODEC_CAP_HIGHBITDEPTH)\n\nso the report will be wrong, but I suppose the creation of the codec would fail. the alternative would be to define a VPX_CODEC_CAP_HIGHBITDEPTH_DECODER",
