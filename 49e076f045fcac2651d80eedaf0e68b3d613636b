      "message": "I propose something like: \n\nThis commit adds an encoder work around to support better compatibility with a non-compliant hardware vp9 profile 2 decoder. The known issue with this decoder is:  \n\nThe decoder assumes a wrong value, 127 instead of the correct value of 511 and 2047, for any assumed top-left corner pixel in UV planes for 10 and 12 bit input respectively, such assumed top-left corner pixel is used for INTRA prediction when the pixel is a real decoded/reconstructed pixel, e.g. when it is located inside the row above the top row or inside the column left to the leftest column of a video image.",
