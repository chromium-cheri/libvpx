      "message": "these branches only need to be done once. have you checked to see that they\u0027re removed from the loop? if not it may be better to have explicit checks on the 4/8/16/32/64 widths. That would also allow finer control of unrolling, we avoid unrolling 64 on neon for instance, but operate on 2 rows in the other branches",

      "message": "Thanks for suggestion.  Moving those branches out of the loop speeds up functions quite obviously.  Unrolling block width, 4/8/16 speeds up function visibly. So they work as two row each iteration.  For block width 32/64, the speed up is not visible so they still work for row by row.",
