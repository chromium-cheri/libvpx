      "message": "The reason we\u0027re having problems with `mt_current_mb_col` is that its size is implicitly `cm-\u003emb_rows`. So whenever `cm-\u003emb_rows` changes, we need to reallocate `mt_current_mb_col` at the same time. But we also want to allocate `mt_current_mb_col` only when we need it (i.e., only when we are using multiple threads). It was tricky to meet both requirements.\n\nBy recording the size of `mt_current_mb_col` explicitly in this new field and by allocating `mt_current_mb_col` right before we start to use it, it is much easier to meet both requirements.",
