I think what you\u0027d want to check (in addition to this test) is that if you drop a droppable frame, all later frames decode exactly as they do if that frame is not dropped. ie, take a checksum of the frames without dropping, then decode with drops and verify that they\u0027re still exactly the same.\n\nTesting that the PSNR doesn\u0027t get hurt by more than x% is good too, to see that just enabling the mode doesn\u0027t hurt quality too badly even when there are no drops.\n\nAlso, this should be in its own TEST_P.",
