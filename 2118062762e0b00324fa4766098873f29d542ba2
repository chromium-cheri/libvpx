      "message": "So we are trying to keep track of the last Q a block was coded at. In the general case this is just the current Q that we are coding it at. However if a block is 0,0-skip then it really hasn\u0027t been coded again, the Q that it has previously been coded at remains the best indication of the last value it was quantized at. For intra-blocks even if they have no residual (skip), they are clearly being coded at the current active Q.\n\nNow this approximation clearly falls apart for inter non-0,0 blocks, the previous active Q should follow the motion vector not just sit in the current spatial location. Likewise if the reference is golden frame, then we should use Q from golden frame, not last frame.",
