Android.mk will build vpx unittests on android.  These unittests must be
manually transferred to an android device and run via adb shell.  To build
these unittests you must have the android NDK.  Then, run configure with
--sdk=$NDK.  Run the get_files.py script to dowload test files and then
manually transfer them to an android device with adb.  Build these unit tests
by invoking ndk-build from the parent directory of libvpx something like:
NDK_PROJECT_PATH=. ndk-build APP_BUILD_SCRIPT=./libvpx/test/android/Android.mk APP_ABI=armeabi-v7a APP_PLATFORM=android-18 APP_OPTIM=release APP_STL=gnustl_static APP_CPPFLAGS=-frtti
