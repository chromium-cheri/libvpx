      "message": "I thought about that.  But default_coef_counts is defined in defaultcoefcounts.h which has no dependencies and I was trying to leave it like that.  The typedef can\u0027t be defaultcoefcounts.h because of the static table being defined so the file should only be included once.\n\nThe const is the problem with the casting.  So I still think you would need to cast in your example.  It would be cleaner/clearer.  I considered removing the const, but the table really is constant and having it as const should help in catching incorrect writes.",
