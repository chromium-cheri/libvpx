      "message": "I think this looks OK though I intend ultimately to present most of the controls as a factor that adjusts the behavior either side of the current default behavior, rather then the raw value. Hence for example I now have the sr_diff_factor field instead of the sr_diff_part. As such we may want to change names to reflect this as we change them over to this form. We will also need to do the RD parameters but again I am looking to work out a better way of presenting that and hopefully reduce it to one factor each for inter and key frames as the current tweaking of individual multipliers at specific Q thresholds is likely going to cause problems and over-fitting.\n\nFor now lets use this to test the process but we may need to tweak the names, value ranges etc later.\n\n",
