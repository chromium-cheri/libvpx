      "message": "This seems like some assumptions are going wrong in the 4x4 code - e.g. we may be adding a ib\u003d0,1,2,3 even though they should be 0 for all (if BLOCK_SIZE_AB4X4), and xd-\u003eab_index should probably be 0-3 instead, right?\n\nHaving ib and wb/wh be inconsistent means that further down, the code that checks which blocks to apply adst/dct to, will fail to do the intended thing, and instead do something essentially at random, I think.",

      "message": "Yes, xd-\u003eab_index goes from 0 to 3. the intra4x4 coding is still handled in as a special case. We probably should combine this with other superblock intra coding later(?) at that time, we need to convert this use of ib into xd-\u003eab_index. Before we get to this point, ib still goes from 0 to 3.",
