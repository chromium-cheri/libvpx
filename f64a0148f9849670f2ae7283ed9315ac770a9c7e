If we\u0027re a keyframe and segmentation is enabled, we should assert that update_mb_segmentation_map is set.\n\nLikewise, if we\u0027re a keyframe, we can assert that cm-\u003etemporal_update is not set.\n\nThat way, frame_type is only used in assert calls, and is otherwise unused in this function, which is the intention.",
