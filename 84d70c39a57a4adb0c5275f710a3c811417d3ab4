      "message": "The VP8 code in libvpx doesn\u0027t use pthread mutexes and condition variables for synchronization. Instead, it uses atomic variables and POSIX semaphores.\n\nAll the `sem_wait()` calls in VP8 should handle EINTR. Since this CL is a speculative fix, I am first fixing the two `sem_wait(\u0026cpi-\u003eh_event_end_lpf)` calls that I can interrupt with Ctrl-C and cause the same crash in bug chromium:324459561.\n\nThe reason I consider this fix as speculative is that there is no evidence in bug chromium:324459561 that vp8_encoder_fuzz_test was interrupted by a signal. But this is the only way I know to reproduce the crash.",
