      "message": "only for left, not for above; above uses different offsets for each col tile and is thus always independent between col tiles. For row tiles, the decoder expects it to _not_ be independent between row tiles, and this change adjusts the encoder to do that too. Other contexts work alike (independent between col tiles, but not row tiles).",
